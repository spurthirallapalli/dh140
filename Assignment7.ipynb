    "For this assigment, I will analyze *Romeo and Juliet* like I did in Assignment 6. I found the plain text UTF-8 file on the Projet Gutenberg website at this link: https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1513/pg1513.txt. I will actually be using a different way to obtain the contents than I did last time. Last week, I used requests, but along with the text of the play came a bunch of text from Project Gutenberg itself, which I did not want. So this time, I will download the file, clean up some of the information, and then open() like we did with Macbeth."

A public place.\\n\\n Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nGregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nNo, for then we should be colliers.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nI mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nAy, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nI strike quickly, being moved.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou\\nart moved, thou runn’st away.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand.\\nI will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nThat shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nTrue, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to\\nthe wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and\\nthrust his maids to the wall.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\n’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the\\nmen I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nThe heads of the maids?\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense\\nthou wilt.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nThey must take it in sense that feel it.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a\\npretty piece of flesh.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\n’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.\\nDraw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.\\n\\n Enter Abram and Balthasar.\\n\\nSAMPSON.\\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.\\n\\nGREGORY.\\nHow?

I hate the word\\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\\nHave at thee, coward.\\n\\n [_They fight._]\\n\\n Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.\\n\\nFIRST CITIZEN.\\nClubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!\\nDown with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\\n\\n Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nA crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nMy sword, I say!

What, ho! You men, you beasts,\\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,\\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\\nThrow your mistemper’d weapons to the ground\\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\\nHave thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,\\nAnd made Verona’s ancient citizens\\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\\nCanker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.\\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\\nFor this time all the rest depart away:\\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me,\\nAnd Montague, come you this afternoon,\\nTo know our farther pleasure in this case,\\nTo old Free-town, our common judgement-place.\\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,\\n Citizens and Servants._]\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nHere were the servants of your adversary\\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\\nI drew to part them, in the instant came\\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,\\nWhich, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,\\nHe swung about his head, and cut the winds,\\nWho nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.\\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\\nCame more and more, and fought on part and part,\\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\\n\\nLADY MONTAGUE.\\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?\\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun\\nPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,\\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\\nSo early walking did I see your son.\\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me,\\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,\\nBeing one too many by my weary self,\\nPursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,\\nAnd gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,\\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\\nThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,\\nAway from light steals home my heavy son,\\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nHave you importun’d him by any means?\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nBoth by myself and many other friends;\\nBut he, his own affections’ counsellor,\\nIs to himself—I will not say how true—\\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\\n\\n Enter Romeo.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;\\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,\\n\\n [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nGood morrow, cousin.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nIs the day so young?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nBut new struck nine.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nIn love?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nOut.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nOf love?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nOut of her favour where I am in love.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nAlas that love so gentle in his view,\\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,\\nShould, without eyes, see pathways to his will!\\nWhere shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\\nHere’s much to do with hate, but more with love:\\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\\nO anything, of nothing first create!\\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\\nDost thou not laugh?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nNo coz, I rather weep.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nGood heart, at what?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nAt thy good heart’s oppression.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhy such is love’s transgression.\\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\nWhich thou wilt propagate to have it prest\\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\\nBeing purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\\nBeing vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:\\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\nFarewell, my coz.\\n\\n [_Going._]\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nSoft! I will go along:\\nAnd if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nTut! I have lost myself; I am not here.\\nThis is not Romeo, he’s some other where.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nTell me in sadness who is that you love?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nGroan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will,\\nA word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.\\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nI aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nA right good markman, and she’s fair I love.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWell, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit\\nWith Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;\\nAnd in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,\\nFrom love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.\\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms\\nNor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,\\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:\\nO she’s rich in beauty, only poor\\nThat when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\\nFor beauty starv’d with her severity,\\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\\nShe is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,\\nTo merit bliss by making me despair.\\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\\nDo I live dead, that live to tell it now.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nBe rul’d by me, forget to think of her.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nO teach me how I should forget to think.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\\nExamine other beauties.\\n\\nROMEO.\\n’Tis the way\\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.\\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,\\nBeing black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;\\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair,\\nWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note\\nWhere I may read who pass’d that passing fair?\\nFarewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nI’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE II. A Street.\\n\\n Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\\nIn penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,\\nFor men so old as we to keep the peace.\\n\\nPARIS.\\nOf honourable reckoning are you both,\\nAnd pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.\\nBut now my lord, what say you to my suit?\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nBut saying o’er what I have said before.\\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world,\\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\\nLet two more summers wither in their pride\\nEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.\\n\\nPARIS.\\nYounger than she are happy mothers made.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nAnd too soon marr’d are those so early made.\\nThe earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,\\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth:\\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,\\nMy will to her consent is but a part;\\nAnd she agree, within her scope of choice\\nLies my consent and fair according voice.\\nThis night I hold an old accustom’d feast,\\nWhereto I have invited many a guest,\\nSuch as I love, and you among the store,\\nOne more, most welcome, makes my number more.\\nAt my poor house look to behold this night\\nEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:\\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel\\nWhen well apparell’d April on the heel\\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight\\nAmong fresh female buds shall you this night\\nInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\\nAnd like her most whose merit most shall be:\\nWhich, on more view of many, mine, being one,\\nMay stand in number, though in reckoning none.\\nCome, go with me.

I must to the learned. In good\\ntime!\\n\\n Enter Benvolio and Romeo.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nTut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,\\nOne pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;\\nTurn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\\nOne desperate grief cures with another’s languish:\\nTake thou some new infection to thy eye,\\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nYour plantain leaf is excellent for that.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nFor what, I pray thee?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nFor your broken shin.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nWhy, Romeo, art thou mad?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nNot mad, but bound more than a madman is:\\nShut up in prison, kept without my food,\\nWhipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.\\n\\nSERVANT.\\nGod gi’ go-den.

Well, Susan is with God;\\nShe was too good for me.

But as I said,\\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\\nTo see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!\\nShake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,\\nTo bid me trudge.\\nAnd since that time it is eleven years;\\nFor then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood\\nShe could have run and waddled all about;\\nFor even the day before she broke her brow,\\nAnd then my husband,—God be with his soul!\\nA was a merry man,—took up the child:\\n‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?\\nThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,\\nThe pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.\\nTo see now how a jest shall come about.\\nI warrant, and I should live a thousand years,\\nI never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;\\nAnd, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nEnough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nYes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,\\nTo think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;\\nAnd yet I warrant it had upon it brow\\nA bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;\\nA perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.\\n‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?\\nThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nPeace, I have done.

And is he a man to encounter\\nTybalt?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nWhy, what is Tybalt?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nMore than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of\\ncompliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,\\nand proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in\\nyour bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;\\na gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,\\nthe immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nThe what?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThe pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners\\nof accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good\\nwhore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should\\nbe thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,\\nthese pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot\\nsit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!\\n\\n Enter Romeo.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou\\nfishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to\\nhis lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to\\nberhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings\\nand harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior\\nRomeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You\\ngave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThe slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nPardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as\\nmine a man may strain courtesy.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThat’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow\\nin the hams.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nMeaning, to curtsy.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThou hast most kindly hit it.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nA most courteous exposition.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nPink for flower.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nRight.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nSure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,\\nthat when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the\\nwearing, solely singular.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nSwits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nNay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast\\nmore of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my\\nwhole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nThou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the\\ngoose.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nNay, good goose, bite not.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAnd is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nO here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an\\nell broad.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves\\nthee far and wide a broad goose.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nWhy, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou\\nsociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as\\nwell as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nStop there, stop there.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\\nwhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\\nlonger.\\n\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nHere’s goodly gear!\\nA sail, a sail!\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nPeter!\\n\\nPETER.\\nAnon.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nMy fan, Peter.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nIs it good-den?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\\nprick of noon.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\\ncan any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\\nthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\\nfault of a worse.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nYou say well.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nShe will endite him to some supper.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat hast thou found?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\\nstale and hoar ere it be spent.\\n[_Sings._]\\n    An old hare hoar,\\n    And an old hare hoar,\\n  Is very good meat in Lent;\\n    But a hare that is hoar\\n    Is too much for a score\\n  When it hoars ere it be spent.\\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI will follow you.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\n\\nNURSE.\\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\\nropery?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\\nhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\\nuse me at his pleasure!\\n\\nPETER.\\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\\nvery weak dealing.\\n\\nROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\nthee,—\\n\\nNURSE.\\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\\nbe a joyful woman.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\\ngentlemanlike offer.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nBid her devise\\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nGo to; I say you shall.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\\nParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nCommend me to thy lady.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nAy, a thousand times.

Answer to that;\\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\\nLet me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\\nflower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\\nways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\\n\\nJULIET.\\nNo, no.

Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband?

A Street.\\n\\n Enter Romeo.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nIf I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,\\nMy dreams presage some joyful news at hand.\\nMy bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;\\nAnd all this day an unaccustom’d spirit\\nLifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.\\nI dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—\\nStrange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—\\nAnd breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,\\nThat I reviv’d, and was an emperor.\\nAh me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,\\nWhen but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.\\n\\n Enter Balthasar.\\n\\nNews from Verona! How now, Balthasar?\\nDost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?\\nHow doth my lady? Is my father well?\\nHow fares my Juliet? That I ask again;\\nFor nothing can be ill if she be well.\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nThen she is well, and nothing can be ill.\\nHer body sleeps in Capel’s monument,\\nAnd her immortal part with angels lives.\\nI saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,\\nAnd presently took post to tell it you.\\nO pardon me for bringing these ill news,\\nSince you did leave it for my office, sir.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nIs it even so? Then I defy you, stars!\\nThou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,\\nAnd hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nI do beseech you sir, have patience.\\nYour looks are pale and wild, and do import\\nSome misadventure.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nTush, thou art deceiv’d.\\nLeave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.\\nHast thou no letters to me from the Friar?\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nNo, my good lord.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nNo matter. Get thee gone,\\nAnd hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.\\n\\n [_Exit Balthasar._]\\n\\nWell, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.\\nLet’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift\\nTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men.\\nI do remember an apothecary,—\\nAnd hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted\\nIn tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,\\nCulling of simples, meagre were his looks,\\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones;\\nAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\\nAn alligator stuff’d, and other skins\\nOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,\\nGreen earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\\nWere thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.\\nNoting this penury, to myself I said,\\nAnd if a man did need a poison now,\\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,\\nHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,\\nAnd this same needy man must sell it me.\\nAs I remember, this should be the house.\\nBeing holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.\\nWhat, ho! Apothecary!\\n\\n Enter Apothecary.\\n\\nAPOTHECARY.\\nWho calls so loud?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\\nHold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\\nA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins,\\nThat the life-weary taker may fall dead,\\nAnd that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath\\nAs violently as hasty powder fir’d\\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.\\n\\nAPOTHECARY.\\nSuch mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law\\nIs death to any he that utters them.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,\\nAnd fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\\nNeed and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.\\nThe world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;\\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich;\\nThen be not poor, but break it and take this.\\n\\nAPOTHECARY.\\nMy poverty, but not my will consents.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI pay thy poverty, and not thy will.\\n\\nAPOTHECARY.\\nPut this in any liquid thing you will\\nAnd drink it off; and, if you had the strength\\nOf twenty men, it would despatch you straight.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nThere is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,\\nDoing more murder in this loathsome world\\nThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\\nI sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.\\nFarewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.\\nCome, cordial and not poison, go with me\\nTo Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE II. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\\n\\n Enter Friar John.\\n\\nFRIAR JOHN.\\nHoly Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!\\n\\n Enter Friar Lawrence.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nThis same should be the voice of Friar John.\\nWelcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?\\nOr, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.\\n\\nFRIAR JOHN.\\nGoing to find a barefoot brother out,\\nOne of our order, to associate me,\\nHere in this city visiting the sick,\\nAnd finding him, the searchers of the town,\\nSuspecting that we both were in a house\\nWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,\\nSeal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,\\nSo that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nWho bare my letter then to Romeo?\\n\\nFRIAR JOHN.\\nI could not send it,—here it is again,—\\nNor get a messenger to bring it thee,\\nSo fearful were they of infection.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nUnhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\\nThe letter was not nice, but full of charge,\\nOf dear import, and the neglecting it\\nMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence,\\nGet me an iron crow and bring it straight\\nUnto my cell.\\n\\nFRIAR JOHN.\\nBrother, I’ll go and bring it thee.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nNow must I to the monument alone.\\nWithin this three hours will fair Juliet wake.\\nShe will beshrew me much that Romeo\\nHath had no notice of these accidents;\\nBut I will write again to Mantua,\\nAnd keep her at my cell till Romeo come.\\nPoor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nSCENE III. A churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.\\n\\n Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.\\n\\nPARIS.\\nGive me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.\\nYet put it out, for I would not be seen.\\nUnder yond yew tree lay thee all along,\\nHolding thy ear close to the hollow ground;\\nSo shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,\\nBeing loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,\\nBut thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,\\nAs signal that thou hear’st something approach.\\nGive me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.\\n\\nPAGE.\\n[_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone\\nHere in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.\\n\\n [_Retires._]\\n\\nPARIS.\\nSweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.\\nO woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,\\nWhich with sweet water nightly I will dew,\\nOr wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.\\nThe obsequies that I for thee will keep,\\nNightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.\\n\\n [_The Page whistles._]\\n\\nThe boy gives warning something doth approach.\\nWhat cursed foot wanders this way tonight,\\nTo cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?\\nWhat, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.\\n\\n [_Retires._]\\n\\n Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nGive me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\\nHold, take this letter; early in the morning\\nSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.\\nGive me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,\\nWhate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof\\nAnd do not interrupt me in my course.\\nWhy I descend into this bed of death\\nIs partly to behold my lady’s face,\\nBut chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\\nA precious ring, a ring that I must use\\nIn dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\\nBut if thou jealous dost return to pry\\nIn what I further shall intend to do,\\nBy heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,\\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild;\\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\\nLive, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nFor all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.\\nHis looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.\\n\\n [_Retires_]\\n\\nROMEO.\\nThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\\nGorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,\\nThus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\\n\\n [_Breaking open the door of the monument._]\\n\\nAnd in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.\\n\\nPARIS.\\nThis is that banish’d haughty Montague\\nThat murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,\\nIt is supposed, the fair creature died,—\\nAnd here is come to do some villanous shame\\nTo the dead bodies.

Think upon these gone;\\nLet them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\\nPut not another sin upon my head\\nBy urging me to fury. O be gone.\\nBy heaven I love thee better than myself;\\nFor I come hither arm’d against myself.\\nStay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,\\nA madman’s mercy bid thee run away.\\n\\nPARIS.\\nI do defy thy conjuration,\\nAnd apprehend thee for a felon here.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\\n\\n [_They fight._]\\n\\nPAGE.\\nO lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nPARIS.\\nO, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful,\\nOpen the tomb, lay me with Juliet.\\n\\n [_Dies._]\\n\\nROMEO.\\nIn faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\\nMercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!\\nWhat said my man, when my betossed soul\\nDid not attend him as we rode? I think\\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.\\nSaid he not so? Or did I dream it so?\\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,\\nTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.\\nI’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\\nA grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,\\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.\\n\\n [_Laying Paris in the monument._]\\n\\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\\nHave they been merry! Which their keepers call\\nA lightning before death. O, how may I\\nCall this a lightning? O my love, my wife,\\nDeath that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,\\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\\nThou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet\\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\nAnd death’s pale flag is not advanced there.\\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\nO, what more favour can I do to thee\\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,\\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous;\\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee,\\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\\nWill I set up my everlasting rest;\\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.\\nArms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you\\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death.\\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.\\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\nThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.\\nHere’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!\\nThy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.\\n\\n [_Dies._]\\n\\n Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a\\n lantern, crow, and spade.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nSaint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight\\nHave my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?\\nWho is it that consorts, so late, the dead?\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nHere’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nBliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,\\nWhat torch is yond that vainly lends his light\\nTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\\nIt burneth in the Capels’ monument.\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nIt doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,\\nOne that you love.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nWho is it?\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nRomeo.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nHow long hath he been there?\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nFull half an hour.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nGo with me to the vault.\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nI dare not, sir;\\nMy master knows not but I am gone hence,\\nAnd fearfully did menace me with death\\nIf I did stay to look on his intents.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nStay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\\nO, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nAs I did sleep under this yew tree here,\\nI dreamt my master and another fought,\\nAnd that my master slew him.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nRomeo! [_Advances._]\\nAlack, alack, what blood is this which stains\\nThe stony entrance of this sepulchre?\\nWhat mean these masterless and gory swords\\nTo lie discolour’d by this place of peace?\\n\\n [_Enters the monument._]\\n\\nRomeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\\nAnd steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour\\nIs guilty of this lamentable chance?\\nThe lady stirs.\\n\\n [_Juliet wakes and stirs._]\\n\\nJULIET.\\nO comfortable Friar, where is my lord?\\nI do remember well where I should be,\\nAnd there I am. Where is my Romeo?\\n\\n [_Noise within._]\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nI hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest\\nOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\\nA greater power than we can contradict\\nHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\\nThy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\\nAnd Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee\\nAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns.\\nStay not to question, for the watch is coming.\\nCome, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nGo, get thee hence, for I will not away.\\n\\n [_Exit Friar Lawrence._]\\n\\nWhat’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?\\nPoison, I see, hath been his timeless end.\\nO churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop\\nTo help me after? I will kiss thy lips.\\nHaply some poison yet doth hang on them,\\nTo make me die with a restorative.\\n\\n [_Kisses him._]\\n\\nThy lips are warm!\\n\\nFIRST WATCH.\\n[_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?\\n\\nJULIET.\\nYea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger.\\n\\n [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._]\\n\\nThis is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die.\\n\\n [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._]\\n\\n Enter Watch with the Page of Paris.\\n\\nPAGE.\\nThis is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.\\n\\nFIRST WATCH.\\nThe ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.\\nGo, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.\\n\\n [_Exeunt some of the Watch._]\\n\\nPitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,\\nAnd Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\\nWho here hath lain this two days buried.\\nGo tell the Prince; run to the Capulets.\\nRaise up the Montagues, some others search.\\n\\n [_Exeunt others of the Watch._]\\n\\nWe see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\\nBut the true ground of all these piteous woes\\nWe cannot without circumstance descry.\\n\\n Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.\\n\\nSECOND WATCH.\\nHere’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.\\n\\nFIRST WATCH.\\nHold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\\n\\n Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.\\n\\nTHIRD WATCH.

Stay the Friar too.\\n\\n Enter the Prince and Attendants.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nWhat misadventure is so early up,\\nThat calls our person from our morning’s rest?\\n\\n Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nWhat should it be that they so shriek abroad?\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nO the people in the street cry Romeo,\\nSome Juliet, and some Paris, and all run\\nWith open outcry toward our monument.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?\\n\\nFIRST WATCH.\\nSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,\\nAnd Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,\\nWarm and new kill’d.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nSearch, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\\n\\nFIRST WATCH.\\nHere is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,\\nWith instruments upon them fit to open\\nThese dead men’s tombs.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nO heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\\nThis dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house\\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\\nAnd it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nO me! This sight of death is as a bell\\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.\\n\\n Enter Montague and others.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nCome, Montague, for thou art early up,\\nTo see thy son and heir more early down.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.\\nGrief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.\\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nLook, and thou shalt see.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,\\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\\nTill we can clear these ambiguities,\\nAnd know their spring, their head, their true descent,\\nAnd then will I be general of your woes,\\nAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\\nDoth make against me, of this direful murder.\\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\\nMyself condemned and myself excus’d.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.\\nI married them; and their stol’n marriage day\\nWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death\\nBanish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.\\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\\nBetroth’d, and would have married her perforce\\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,\\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\\nBeing the time the potion’s force should cease.\\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\nWas stay’d by accident; and yesternight\\nReturn’d my letter back. Then all alone\\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\\nAnd threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\\n\\nPAGE.\\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\\nOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\\nCan I demand.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nBut I can give thee more,\\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\\nFor never was a story of more woe\\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]'"
