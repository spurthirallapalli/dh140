### About Me
Hi everyone! My name is Spurthi Rallapalli and I am a 4th year Computer Science Major & Public Affairs Minor! I am taking DH 140 (Coding for Humanities) Winter 2022. 

### Description of Course
DH 140, Coding for Humanities, teaches us how to use computing in order to (help) answer humanistic questions. In this course, we will be using Python to "critically describe, analyze, and visualize data in the context of the humanities" and "demonstrate the value of data for discovery, exploration, and analysis", among many other things. 

### Project Ideas
None so far!

### Objectives for the Class
- How to **apply computing to humanities questions**
- How to use **Python** for **visualization and related techniques**
- How to **analyze computing using humanities data**
- How to take into account that **computing might not be able to explain/predict the answer to many humanities questions**
